I took specifically the csv dataset from IBM to predict IBM stocks and also to test the RNN model against stocks of different companies - Google and P&G.

Built 2 LSTM layers as that was shown to be sufficient. Trained the neural network between 1 to 6 epochs as the training loss has trended towards 0.02 on average
